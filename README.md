# Portfolio Website

A responsive personal portfolio website to showcase my projects, skills, and contact information as a first‑year CSE (AI/ML) student. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and deployed using GitHub Pages. This site is focused on clean design, fast loading, and being easy to update as I complete new projects and internships.
